                I was assigned to create a Maintenance Notification section for the employee web portal that
                keeps track of the maintenance notifications records as well as send
                those notifications at the indicated time as emails. The purpose of this project is to build a tool to 
                make creating a professional email easier to that the deployment
                engineer do not have to worry about formatting an email and
                sending it at a specific time for the maintenance.
                <br />
                <br />
                First, I had a meeting with my team leader to gather requirements, his ideas for
                the layouts and some use cases to create mockup pages using paint.net.

                Add Maintenance Notification Mockup page

            </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-2"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <div class="col-lg-2">&nbsp;</div>
            <div class="col-lg-8" style="margin:1% 0">
                <p>
                    With those mockup pages, we had a meeting with the stakeholders (our
                    teamâ€™s System Analyst) to discuss improvements on the layouts and
                    logics on implementation.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Once everything is well planned out, I began the implementation,
                    creating one page and its functionalities at a time, and going back to
                    it after its dependencies has been implemented. For example, I created
                    the List Maintenance Notification page when the Maintenance Table in
                    the database is still empty as I needed that page to have a link to
                    bring me to the Add New Maintenance page. Once I am able to create a
                    new Maintenance Notification record, I went back to the List page to
                    get the records to be properly displayed.
                </p>
                <div class="container">
                    <img src="/images/listMaintenanceNotifScreenShot.png" width="100%"/>
                    <p class="caption">
                    A screenshot of the List Maintenance Notification page
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    
        <div class="col-lg-12" style="margin-top: 2%">
            <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6" style="margin-top: 2%">
            <p>
                I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, AngularJS and Ajax for the
                front-end to display the records, the form for creating the records
                and to pass the inputted data to the server. For the backend I mainly
                used C# and LINQ to insert and retrieve data from the database, as
                well as sending the notification as an email.
                <br />
                <br />
                My team leader was satisfied with the features I included in the pages
                and the extra effort I spent in order to meet the deadline of the
                project. Now the job of creating a maintenance notification can easily
                be done by an employee from a different team and the Application
                Development Team can focus on other projects or the details of the
                deployment.
